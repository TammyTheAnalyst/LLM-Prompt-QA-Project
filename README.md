# LLM Prompt QA Project

This project simulates how AI teams evaluate GPT-4 responses for clarity, accuracy, tone, and helpfulness — using Python and LangChain.

It reflects real-world work I’ve done reviewing and scoring AI-generated content across text, voice, and search-based outputs.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

Evaluate GPT-4 outputs using LangChain and Python, and build a scoring system to assess:
- ✍️ Clarity  
- 📊 Factual Accuracy  
- 🎯 Tone & Relevance
